# COVID-19 Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on COVID-19 patient data to uncover insights, patterns, and correlations. The goal is to analyze how different factors influence patient outcomes, identify risk groups, and provide actionable insights for better decision-making.

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Data & Methodology
### **Dataset:**
- The dataset contains patient information, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes.
- Data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and irrelevant features are removed.

### **EDA Steps:**
✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
✔ Univariate & Bivariate Analysis  
✔ Correlation Analysis  
✔ Outlier Detection  
✔ Feature Engineering  
✔ Visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn  

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings
🔹 **Age & Mortality:** Older patients have a higher risk of death.  
🔹 **Comorbidities:** Hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases significantly impact severity.  
🔹 **ICU & Intubation:** Patients requiring ICU or intubation have a much higher fatality rate.  
🔹 **Preventive Measures:** Early detection and treatment for high-risk groups are crucial.  

## 🚀 Running the Project
### **Run Jupyter Notebook**
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open the notebooks inside `notebooks/` folder and explore the EDA.
